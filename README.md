Good Work uses React.js for its front end and Ruby On Rails for its back end.

Good Work is a stress and anxiety reducing app that utilizes goal tracking and partner accountability.

## Install Instructions

  1. After cloning the lab, navigate to the repository.
  
  2. Type "npm install" and hit enter. Node Package Manager will install all of the node modules.
  
## Running the Application
  *As of right now, the fetch requests are made from the local host, so you must boot that up before running the front end.*
  
  1. Be sure to have run a bundle install and db:migration in the back end.
  
  2. Navigate to the back end repository.
  
  3. Type "rails s" and hit enter.
  
  4. Once your server is running, navigate back to this repository.
  
  5. Type "npm start" and hit enter. 
  
  6. You will be prompted and asked if you would like to run the front end on another port. Press "y". Then the server will start.
  
  7. Enjoy!
